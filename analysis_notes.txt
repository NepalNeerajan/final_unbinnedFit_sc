-> This directory is created, the unbinned fit functins will be modified as discussed from last meeting
TO DO:
(1) calculate chi2/ndf for all three decay histograms
done, in local computer
to do: to check in cmich computer and confirm result comparing with previous results

(2) get number of degrees of freedom consistently (rather than hard coded)
done, in cmich computer
todo: if result match with previous results

(3) all plot with fit residuals going up to 10 second (or the upper limit of fit)
done: fit range and defination from function, hard-coded method is now removed

(4) add histogram of negative times and plot on tto of it the background function; it could be tricky! 
added negative time, but need to check in cmich computer weather it work or not (there could be conflict in the resiudal histograms), still need to find a way to plot background function top of it
