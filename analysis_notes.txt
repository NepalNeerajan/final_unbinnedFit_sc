-> This directory is created, the unbinned fit functins will be modified as discussed from last meeting
TO DO:
(1) calculate chi2/ndf for all three decay histograms
done, in local computer
to do: to check in cmich computer and confirm result comparing with previous results

(2) get number of degrees of freedom consistently (rather than hard coded)
done, in cmich computer
todo: if result match with previous results

(3) all plot with fit residuals going up to 10 second (or the upper limit of fit)
(4) add histogram of negative times and plot on tto of it the background function; it could be tricky!
